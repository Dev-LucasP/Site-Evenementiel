            I've had a passion for Pop-Culture since I was very young. I started
            collecting figurines and goodies in 2008 and haven't stopped since.
            As an early fan, I felt it was my duty to bring other fans together
            around a common passion. That's why my two partners and I created
            Len Expo.

            As a fan of pop culture from an early age, I wanted to bring people
            together so that they could immerse themselves in the excitement of
            a captivating convention and have wonderful memories with their
            loved ones.

        <p class="txtentreprise">
          The LEN expo company was founded by the above 3 people, and has been
          running conventions in several locations in France, with plans to
          expand to other countries to share this passion for pop culture with
          even more people!
        </p>
        <p class="txtentreprise">
          Our head office is in Lens, where we plan and organize our next events
          with the help of our collaborators and employees.
        </p>
        <p class="txtentreprise">
          The LEN expo project began at the start of 2022, during which we
          forged links with collaborators and found the material to achieve our
          goal of organizing our first convention.
        </p>
        <p class="txtentreprise">
          LEN expo is currently focused on pop culture events, but in the future
          we may also organize events on other subjects.
        </p>
        <p class="txtentreprise">
          LEN expo is still a new company on the market, and we're hoping to
          stand out from the crowd, as the competition is tough. Despite this,
          we've managed to bring together a host of exhibitors and guests for
          this first edition, some of whom you can find on our home page.
